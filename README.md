# Physics 5BL stuff

This repository contains the code and lab reports for the Physics 5BL labs at UCB, Spring 2024. The labs cover the following concepts:
- Hooke's Law
- Simple Harmonic Motion
- Kirchhoff's Rules
- Existential Dread
- The Doppler Effect

## Tech Stack
The data is outputted to `.csv` files. It is processed in `Jupyter` notebooks with `numpy`. The data is then plotted using `matplotlib`.

The lab report is constructed using `LaTeX`. It can be compiled using the `TeXiFy IDEA` plugin for `IntelliJ IDEA` or, for `VSCode`, the `LaTeX Workshop` extension. To view the pdf in IntelliJ, use the `PDF Viewer` plugin.

Alternatively, the lab report can be compiled by jumping out a window.

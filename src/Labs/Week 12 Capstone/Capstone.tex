    In this report, we will be discussing the results of our capstone project.
    The project was split into two parts.
    The first part was to test different variables in a solenoid to see how they affect the magnetic field.
    We relied on the formula
    \begin{equation}
        emf = -N \frac{d\Phi}{dt}
        \label{eq:emf}
    \end{equation}
    to predict how the magnetic field would change.
    The second part was to create our own solenoid and test it.

    We hung a magnet from a spring to create a changing magnetic field.
    This led to an oscillating current being induced in a solenoid.
    We measured the peak induced current for each setup for consistency.

    First, we set up the solenoid with a constant number of turns and one magnet.
    This gave us a baseline for how the solenoid would behave.

    Next, we doubled the number of turns by adding another solenoid in series.
    Based on Equation~\ref{eq:emf}, we expected the peak current to double.
    The result was a voltage $1.92 \times$ as strong as the original setup.
    This agreed with our prediction.

    We then tested how the number of magnets affected the peak current.
    We doubled the number of magnets, so based on Equation~\ref{eq:emf}, we expected the peak current to double.
    The result was a voltage $1.98 \times$ as strong as the original setup.

    We then tested how the number of turns in the solenoid affected the peak current.
    We doubled the turns, so based on

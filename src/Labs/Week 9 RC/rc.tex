    \section{Part 2A: RLC Underdamped Transient Response}\label{sec:part2a_underdamped}
    \subsection{Methods}\label{subsec:part2a_methods}
    This section covers the first part of experiment 2, which uses an RLC Circuit to find the underdamped transient response. We used a 100 mH inductor, 0.1 µF capacitor, and a 50 Ω resistor (two 100 Ω resistors in parallel), as seen in the following diagram:

    caption: Circuit setup for part 2a

    We also used the function generator to create a signal. We used a 10 Hz square wave with 4 Vpp and an output impedance of 50 Ω. We saw the following wave on our oscilloscope:

    We then recorded the peaks of the wave and recorded them in the following data table:

    \begin{table}[h]

    \begin{tabular}{cc}

    2.808 & -16 \\
    3.088 & 8 \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \end{table}

    
    
    \subsection{Analysis}\label{subsec:part2a_analysis}
    We divided each voltage we obtained by the effective resistance (125 Ω)  in order to fit it to the current equation, although its important to note that this only changes the amplitude. We graphed the new data points and fit them to equation (todo underdamped equation). We obtained the following graph and its residuals: 

    todo input part 2a graph and residuals
    caption for graph: Underdamped RLC Circuit data and fit
    caption for residuals: Underdamped RLC Circuit residuals

    From this, we can see that our value for x (\( \alpha \)) is 870.141 +/- 31.419 and w (\( \omega \)) is 9706.289 +/- 101.561. Solving for \( \omega_0 \), using equation (todo omega naught eq in lab notebook), we get 9745.214 +/- 101.194. When we solve for those values using theoretical values and the equations (todo put in equations for alpha and omega, they in lab notebook), we get the values:
    
    \alpha = \frac{125}{2 \times 0.1} = 625
    
    \omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.1^2 \times 10^{-6}}} = \frac{1}{0.1 \times 10^{-3}} = 10000


    We can clearly see a difference in our values for \( \alpha \) and \( \omega_0 \), but they are reasonable. We can do an agreement test from equation (todo agreement test eq) to test our values for \( \omega_0 \) and \( \alpha \) respectively.

    \begin{e}
        \begin{align*}
            |9745.214 - 10000| &\le 2 \sqrt{100^2 + 101.194^2} \\
            245.786 &\le 2 \sqrt{20240.226} \\
            245.786 &\le 284.536
        \end{align*}
    \end{e}
    \begin{e}
        \begin{align*}
            |870.141 - 625| &\ge 2 \sqrt{62.5^2 + 31.419^2} \\
            245.141 &\ge 2 \sqrt{4893.404} \\
            245.141 &\ge 139.904
        \end{align*}
    \end{e}

    As we can see, our value for \( \omega_0 \) is inside our range of accepted values and thus we consider it reasonable. However, our value for \( \alpha \) is outside our accepted range. This could be due to our measured circuit resistance being lower than it actually was. Our measurement error could also have been too low, resulting in a low error and a value outside an accepted range. External factors such as temperature variations or electromagnetic interference from other groups' experiments could also have influenced the circuit's behavior.


    \section{Part 2B: RLC Overdamped Transient Response}\label{sec:part2b_overdamped}
    \subsection{Methods}\label{subsec:part2b_methods}
    This section covers the second part of experiment 2, which uses an RLC Circuit to find the overdamped transient response. We used a 100 mH inductor, 47 µF capacitor, and a 10 kΩ resistor, as seen in the following diagram:

    todo - picture of part 2b circuit
    caption: Circuit setup for part 2b

    We also used the function generator to create a signal. We used a 50 Hz square wave with 4 Vpp and an output impedance of 50 Ω. We saw the following wave on our oscilloscope:

    todo - picture of part 2b graph
    caption: Graph from experiment 2b

    We then recorded the peaks of the wave and recorded them in the following data table:

    \begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Time and Voltage Measurements Part 2B}
    \begin{tabular}{cc}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Time (ms)} & \textbf{Volts (V)} \\
    \midrule
    0.00 & 3.96 \\
    0.16 & 3.08 \\
    0.28 & 2.52 \\
    0.44 & 1.96 \\
    0.64 & 1.48 \\
    0.80 & 1.16 \\
    0.96 & 0.92 \\
    1.16 & 0.68 \\
    1.60 & 0.44 \\
    2.04 & 0.20 \\
    3.76 & 0.12 \\
    5.20 & 0.04 \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \end{table}

    
    \subsection{Analysis}\label{subsec:part2b_analysis}
    We divided each voltage we obtained by the input volgtage (4 V) in
    order to fit it to our equation, although its important to note that
    this only changes the amplitude. We graphed the new data points and fit
    them to equation (todo underdamped equation). We obtained the following
    graph and its residuals:

    todo input part 2b graph and residuals
    caption for graph: overdamped RLC Circuit data and fit
    caption for residuals: overdamped RLC Circuit residuals

    From this, we can see that our graph is a good fit, as it goes through or close to all the points. The residuals are also randomly scattered around the 0 line. Our value for D is 1518.932 +/- 30.657. When we solve for \( \alpha \), it is unnecessary to account for the resistance from the inductor, since the resistor is much larger than the resistance the inductor will provide, allowing us to consider it negligible. Calculating \( \alpha \) using theoretical values and the equation (todo put in equations for alpha they in lab notebook), we get the value:

    \[
    \alpha = \frac{10000}{2 \times 0.1} \\) = 50{,}000
    \]

    We can clearly see a large difference in our value for \( \alpha \). We can do an agreement test from equation (todo agreement test eq) to test our values for \( \alpha \).

    \begin{e}
        \begin{align*}
            |1518.932 - 50000| &\ge 2 \sqrt{30.657^2 + 500^2} \\
            48481.068 &\ge 2 \sqrt{250939.852} \\
            48481.068 &\ge 500.93897
        \end{align*}
    \end{e}

    As we can see, our value for \( \alpha \) is very far outside our accepted range. This could be due to our measured circuit resistance being lower than it actually was. The damping ratio in an RLC circuit could also vary depending on the frequency of the input signal. At certain frequencies, the circuit might exhibit more pronounced oscillations due to resonance effects, resulting in a lower damping ratio. Also, any additional sources of energy loss in the circuit, such as resistance in the connections, stray capacitance, or inductance, could have contributed to the lower value for \( \alpha \).

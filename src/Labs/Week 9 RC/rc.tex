    \section{Part 2A: RLC Underdamped Transient Response}\label{sec:part2a_underdamped}
    \subsection{Methods}\label{subsec:part2a_methods}
    This section covers the first part of experiment 2, which uses an RLC Circuit to find the underdamped transient response. We used a 100 mH inductor, 0.1 µF capacitor, and a 50 Ω resistor (two 100 Ω resistors in parallel), as seen in the following diagram:

    caption: Circuit setup for part 2a

    We also used the function generator to create a signal. We used a 10 Hz square wave with 4 Vpp and an output impedance of 50 Ω. We saw the following wave on our oscilloscope:

    We then recorded the peaks of the wave and recorded them in the following data table:

    \begin{table}[h]

    \caption{Time and Voltage Measurements Part 2A}
    \begin{tabular}{cc}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Time (ms)} & \textbf{Volts (mV)} \\
    \midrule
    0.00 & 3.97 \\
    0.16 & -176 \\
    0.48 & 136 \\
    0.81 & -96 \\
    1.14 & 72 \\
    1.464 & -56 \\
    1.764 & 48 \\
    2.144 & -32 \\
    2.464 & 24 \\
    2.808 & -16 \\
    3.088 & 8 \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \end{table}

    
    
    \subsection{Analysis}\label{subsec:part2a_analysis}
    We divided each voltage we obtained by the effective resistance (125 Ω)  in order to fit it to the current equation, although its important to note that this only changes the amplitude. We graphed the new data points and fit them to equation (todo underdamped equation). We obtained the following graph and its residuals: 

    todo input part 2a graph and residuals
    caption for graph: Underdamped RLC Circuit data and fit
    caption for residuals: Underdamped RLC Circuit residuals

    From this, we can see that our value for x (\( \alpha \)) is 870.141 +/- 31.419 and w (\( \omega \)) is 9706.289 +/- 101.561. Solving for \( \omega_0 \), using equation (todo omega naught eq in lab notebook), we get 9745.214 +/- 101.194. When we solve for those values using theoretical values and the equations (todo put in equations for alpha and omega, they in lab notebook), we get the values:
    
    \alpha = \frac{125}{2 \times 0.1} = 625
    
    \omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.1^2 \times 10^{-6}}} = \frac{1}{0.1 \times 10^{-3}} = 10000


    We can clearly see a difference in our values for \( \alpha \) and \( \omega_0 \), but they are reasonable. We can do an agreement test from equation (todo agreement test eq) to test our values for \( \omega_0 \) and \( \alpha \) respectively.

    \begin{e}
        \begin{align*}
            |9745.214 - 10000| &\le 2 \sqrt{100^2 + 101.194^2} \\
            245.786 &\le 2 \sqrt{20240.226} \\
            245.786 &\le 284.536
        \end{align*}
    \end{e}
    \begin{e}
        \begin{align*}
            |870.141 - 625| &\ge 2 \sqrt{62.5^2 + 31.419^2} \\
            245.141 &\ge 2 \sqrt{4893.404} \\
            245.141 &\ge 139.904
        \end{align*}
    \end{e}

    As we can see, our value for \( \omega_0 \) is inside our range of accepted values and thus we consider it reasonable. However, our value for \( \alpha \) is outside our accepted range. This could be due to our measured circuit resistance being lower than it actually was. Our measurement error could also have been too low, resulting in a low error and a value outside an accepted range. External factors such as temperature variations or electromagnetic interference from other groups' experiments could also have influenced the circuit's behavior.


    \section{Part 2B: RLC Overdamped Transient Response}\label{sec:part2b_overdamped}
    \subsection{Methods}\label{subsec:part2b_methods}
    This section covers the second part of experiment 2, which uses an RLC Circuit to find the overdamped transient response. We used a 100 mH inductor, 47 µF capacitor, and a 10 kΩ resistor, as seen in the following diagram:

    We also used the function generator to create a signal. We used a 50 Hz square wave with 4 Vpp and an output impedance of 50 Ω. We saw the following wave on our oscilloscope:

    We then recorded the peaks of the wave and recorded them in the following data table:
